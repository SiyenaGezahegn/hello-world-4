We chose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct as we wanted to make sure that our project was open source so that anybody would feel comfortable using or contributing to the project. We only wanted to discourage those that would make it so that others would not feel comfortable contributing to our project. We wanted to make this project a safe place for all people. In addition the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct included consequence for those that did not follow the guidelines meaning that it wasn't just words and showed that we would be willing to take action against those who did not follow these guidelines.
